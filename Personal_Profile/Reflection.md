(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
For this project, I focused on creating a smooth and intuitive user experience for the login and sign-up flows on "zheyGo." This included integrating Google and Apple logins, and ensuring the interface worked well on both mobile and desktop. The goal was to make it easy for users to sign in without overcomplicating the process.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
I picked up a better understanding of OAuth for third-party logins and learned how to design authentication flows that feel natural. I also honed my wireframing skills to map out the process visually before jumping into the design.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
I realized the importance of simplicity in designing user authentication. Itâ€™s easy to overwhelm users with too many options, so I worked on making sure the different login methods were clear but not confusing. I also learned the value of consistency across different devices, making sure the experience felt the same whether on a phone or laptop.

Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges was keeping the interface clean and user-friendly, especially with multiple login options. I dealt with this by testing the design across devices and tweaking it based on feedback from users, ensuring it was simple and responsive.

(c) Clarity & Coherence

Throughout the project, I made sure everything stayed organized and easy to follow. I broke down the steps in the user flow, so it was clear how users would interact with each part of the design. Keeping things simple and focused on user needs was key in making sure everything worked smoothly.
