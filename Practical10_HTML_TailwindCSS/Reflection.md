(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
In this project, I worked with TailwindCSS to build a fully responsive webpage. The main things I focused on were:

Responsive Design: I used Tailwind’s responsive classes like sm:, md:, and lg: to make sure the layout looked good on any screen size.
Hover Effects: I added a subtle hover effect to the “Let’s Go!” button that changes its color and size when you hover over it.
Utility-First CSS: Tailwind’s ready-to-use classes made it easy to style elements without writing extra CSS, which sped up my workflow.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired
I learned a lot about TailwindCSS, especially how its utility-first approach makes designing responsive layouts faster and easier.
I also picked up skills in using micro interactions, like hover effects, to improve the user experience.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
This project taught me the importance of responsive design and how small details, like hover effects, can make a webpage feel more interactive and polished. I also got more comfortable using TailwindCSS to handle all the styling.

Challenges Faced
Making It Responsive: Initially, the page didn’t resize well on smaller screens. It took me a bit of trial and error to get it right, but using Tailwind’s responsive classes fixed the issue.
Hover Effect: At first, the hover effect on the button was too sudden. I used Tailwind’s transition utilities to make the change smoother.

(c) Clarity & Coherence

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience with creating a clean and responsive design. It was challenging at times, but I’m happy with the result and feel more confident in my front-end skills now.
