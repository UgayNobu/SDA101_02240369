      <p class="text-lg mb-8">"Hello, I'm Ugyen Norbu, an 18-year-old software engineer and 
        UI designer with a passion for creating responsive, user-friendly web interfaces. In 
        this project, I designed a simple yet functional webpage using TailwindCSS, ensuring it is 
        fully responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes. The layout is clean and intuitive, 
        featuring a micro interaction that enhances the overall user experience. The main interaction 
        is a hover effect on the call-to-action button, which smoothly changes its background color and size, 
        providing a subtle but engaging visual cue for users. This micro interaction is achieved through Tailwind's
         built-in classes for transitions and transforms, allowing for a fluid and dynamic experience. By leveraging 
         TailwindCSS's responsive design utilities, such as sm:, md:, and lg: modifiers, the webpage adjusts its 
         elements like text size and layout to ensure usability across different devices, from mobile screens to 
         larger desktops. This project not only showcases my skills in front-end development but also highlights my 
         attention to detail in creating interactive and accessible user interfaces.".</p>
