(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
I used HTML to create the structure for a registration form and JavaScript for validation. This includes checks for each field (e.g., email format, password matching) and dynamically enabling the "Submit" button when all fields are valid.
New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
I improved my skills in client-side form validation with JavaScript, learned to use event listeners for real-time feedback, and gained a better understanding of HTML attributes like required.

(b) Reflection
What I Learned
This project taught me how to set up JavaScript validation functions to improve data accuracy and user experience. I also learned the importance of real-time feedback on forms.
Challenges Faced
A challenge was matching passwords in real-time. I initially missed this, which led to incorrect submissions. Adding an input event listener resolved this.

How I Overcame the Challenge
By researching JavaScript event listeners and adding if conditions for password matching, I was able to show instant feedback as users typed.

(c) Clarity & Coherence
I aimed for clear code structure and comments, making it easy to understand and modify if needed.
