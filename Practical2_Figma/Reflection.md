(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
For this project, I designed a Netflix-style interface that focuses on organizing content into clear categories like "Top 10 Today" and "Trending Now." The idea was to create a clean, easy-to-navigate layout that stays consistent across different screens, keeping the user experience simple.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
I learned more about designing interfaces that handle a lot of content without feeling cluttered. I also got better at using mockups to plan the user flow and make sure everything is organized in a way thatâ€™s easy to follow.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
I realized how important it is to balance large amounts of content with a clean design. Streaming platforms have so much to show, so I needed to figure out how to display it without overwhelming the user.

Challenges and Solutions
The biggest challenge was managing all the different content sections without making the interface look crowded. I fixed this by adjusting the spacing and layout of each section, and testing the design on different devices to make sure it looked good everywhere.

(c) Clarity & Coherence

Throughout the process, I focused on keeping the design consistent and easy to navigate. By organizing the content clearly, I was able to create a layout that feels smooth and intuitive for users.
