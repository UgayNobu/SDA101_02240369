(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
In this task, I created an HTML page called "My Semester Overview" to organize my classes, to-do list, and study goals. I focused on:

HTML Structure: Using headings and lists to keep things neat and easy to follow.
Semantic HTML: Properly using tags like <h1>, <ul>, and <li> to make sure everything was well-organized.
New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
I got more comfortable structuring information with basic HTML. It was a good chance to practice keeping a page simple and easy to navigate.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
I learned how useful it is to break down content into clear sections. For example, organizing my class schedule and to-do list with lists and headings made the page more readable.

Challenges and Solutions
The biggest challenge was making sure everything stayed clear and didnâ€™t get overwhelming. I solved this by using bullet points and numbered lists, which helped organize the information better.
