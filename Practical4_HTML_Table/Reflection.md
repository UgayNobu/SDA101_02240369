(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied: In this task, I used basic HTML to create a table for my weekly schedule, using tags like <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>. I styled it with some simple CSS to add colors and make it easy to read, like giving the header and lunch break different colors to stand out.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired: I learned how to use the colspan attribute to merge cells, which was new for me, and how to apply basic CSS to a table layout. It was a good practice in combining structure with design for better clarity.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned: This task helped me better understand how HTML tables work, especially when it comes to organizing data in a clean and structured way. I also got more comfortable with using CSS for simple styling.

Challenges Faced: The main challenge was making the "Lunch Break" span across the columns correctly. At first, the cells werenâ€™t lining up as they should, and it took a bit of trial and error with colspan to fix it. Also, figuring out the right colors to use was a bit tricky, but after some testing, I found a color scheme that made the table easy to read.

(c) Clarity & Coherence

I tried to keep this reflection straightforward and easy to follow. I focused on explaining what I did, what I learned, and the challenges I faced in a simple, clear way.
