(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied: I worked on creating a simple HTML form that collects user information. I used basic tags like <form>, <input>, and <select> to build fields for name, date of birth, email, and preferences like gender and meal choices. The idea was to make the form user-friendly and functional.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired: I got more comfortable with different input types such as text, date, and email fields, as well as using radio buttons and drop-down lists. This task really helped me understand how to create forms that gather various types of information from users.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned: I learned how to structure and design a form using HTML thatâ€™s easy to navigate and fills out the needed information properly. It was a good exercise in organizing elements and making them look clean and functional.

Challenges Faced: The biggest challenge was getting all the form elements to line up properly since, at first, they looked messy. I fixed this by tweaking the CSS for better spacing. There was also an issue with the date input field not showing up correctly in some browsers, but after some research, I found a way to handle it by testing on different platforms.
