(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied: I worked on creating a simple list of upcoming college events using HTML. I used an ordered list to show the events and nested unordered lists for the details like time and location. I also applied some basic CSS to make the page look neat and easy to read.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired: I learned how to organize information using nested lists and got more comfortable with basic CSS styling to make the content more readable.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned: This task helped me understand how to display information in a structured way using lists. I also improved my skills in using CSS to make the page look cleaner.

Challenges Faced: I initially had trouble with the alignment of the nested lists—they looked off. After tweaking the CSS margins and padding, I managed to fix the issue.

(c) Clarity & Coherence

I’ve kept this reflection short and to the point, clearly explaining the process, what I learned, and the challenges I faced.
