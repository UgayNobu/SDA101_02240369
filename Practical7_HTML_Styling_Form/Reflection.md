(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
In this project, I built a basic HTML form for seminar registration. I used various form elements like text inputs, email, date pickers, radio buttons for gender, and dropdowns for meal preferences and Dzongkhag selection. I also applied some simple CSS to make sure the form was neat and user-friendly.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
I learned how to create and structure a form in HTML, using different input types depending on the data needed. I also picked up some basic styling techniques to improve the overall look of the form. Finally, I learned how to validate user inputs with different HTML attributes.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
This task gave me a better understanding of how HTML forms work. It was my first time using so many input types together in a single form, and I feel more confident in creating forms now. I also learned the importance of form layout and how CSS can help make the form easier to use.

Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them
I struggled a bit with getting the form elements, like the radio buttons and dropdowns, to align properly. It looked messy at first (see the screenshot). To fix this, I used CSS to adjust the margins and padding, which helped align the fields better. Another challenge was making sure the fields only accepted the correct data types, but I solved this by using the right input types (like email and date).

(c) Clarity & Coherence

I tried to keep my reflection clear and straightforward, explaining the main concepts, what I learned, and the challenges I faced in a logical way.
