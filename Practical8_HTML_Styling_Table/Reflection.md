(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
In this task, I created an HTML table to display grades for different modules. I used basic table elements like <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>. I also applied simple CSS to style the table, such as adding colors to the header row and changing the title font to make it more visually appealing.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
I learned how to structure a table in HTML and use CSS to make it look clean and organized. This helped me better understand how to format and present data in a table format.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
This exercise gave me a good understanding of how to create tables in HTML and style them to make the data clear and easy to read.

Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them
I had trouble aligning the columns in the table at first (see screenshot). To fix this, I adjusted the column widths and added some padding using CSS. I also experimented with font sizes and colors to make the title stand out more.

(c) Clarity & Coherence

I kept my writing simple and organized, making it easy to understand what I did, what I learned, and the challenges I faced.
