(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
For this task, I created a landing page for an online gadget shop using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The main focus was displaying featured products in a clean, organized way.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
I picked up how to use CSS grid to align product cards properly and how to add padding and margins to make everything look neat and well-spaced.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
I learned how to design a simple, visually appealing landing page, and I now have a better understanding of layout techniques with CSS.

Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them
At first, I had trouble spacing the product cards evenly (see screenshot), but I fixed it by tweaking the CSS grid settings. I also had to figure out how to make the page look good on different screen sizes, which I managed by adjusting the layout with CSS.
