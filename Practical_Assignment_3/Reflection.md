(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied:
For this project, I worked with semantic HTML and TailwindCSS to bring the design to life. The focus was on creating a clean, organized HTML structure and using Tailwind’s utility-first approach to quickly style the page. I leaned heavily on flexbox and grid for layout and alignment, making sure everything was responsive and matched the design. I also used hover states and responsive utilities from TailwindCSS to ensure the page worked well across different screen sizes.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:
Before this, I hadn’t used TailwindCSS much, so this project was a great way to dive into it. I learned how to set it up, configure it, and use its utility classes to speed up my workflow. I really appreciated how Tailwind helped me quickly handle responsive design and layout without writing tons of custom CSS. This project also helped me understand the advantages of Tailwind’s utility-first approach in organizing styles efficiently.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned:
This assignment really sharpened my HTML and CSS skills, especially with TailwindCSS. I now feel more confident in setting up a responsive layout and structuring my code in a clean, modular way. Breaking the design down into smaller parts and tackling them step by step helped me keep things manageable, and I’ll definitely carry that approach forward in future projects.

Challenges Faced:
One of the big challenges was setting up TailwindCSS properly. I ran into an issue where the build kept failing because the input.css file was missing. It took a bit of trial and error to figure out that I needed to create the file and include Tailwind’s basic directives (@tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, @tailwind utilities;). Once that was sorted, everything ran smoothly.

Here's a screenshot of the error I encountered during the process:
Making the layout fully responsive was also a bit tricky. I had to tweak the grid and flex settings to make sure the design looked good on different screen sizes, but Tailwind made it easier to adjust things quickly.
